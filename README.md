This is Javier Robalino's Performance Bounceback game. The game was initially designed in a very un-performant way, so it was my task to optimize the scripts, lighting, materials, and project settings to run the game consistently at 90 fps.

## Target Platform

HTC Vive

## Time to Complete Project

2 days

## Something Nice

I enjoyed optimizing the scripts.

## Something Not So Nice

The first time I baked the lighting, the scene was mostly white. After restarting Unity and rebaking, the scene looked as expected. Lighting issues in Unity can be frustrating because you never know if a bake will be successful or look similar to the real-time lights.
